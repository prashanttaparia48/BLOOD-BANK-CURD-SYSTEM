# BLOOD-BANK-CRUD-AND-INVENTORY-SYSTEM
## Overview
The Blood Bank Inventory & Compatibility Manager is a Python-based command-line application designed to manage blood stock levels efficiently. Beyond simple inventory tracking, the system includes a medical logic engine that automatically determines blood type compatibility. It ensures that when a recipient needs blood, the system suggests only medically safe donor types (e.g., O- for generic usage, specific matches for others) and manages stock deductions accordingly.
The system uses persistent storage (CSV) to ensure inventory data is saved between sessions.

## Features
1. Inventory Management: View real-time stock levels for all 8 standard blood types (A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, O-).

2. Smart Compatibility Logic:

3. Automatically identifies valid donors for a specific recipient.

Example: If a recipient needs A+, the system checks inventory for A+, A-, O+, and O-.

4. Donation Tracking: Add new blood units to the inventory with input validation.

5. Safe Dispensing: Prevents dispensing more units than are currently available.

6. Data Persistence: automatically generates and updates a blood_inventory.csv file. If the program is closed, data is saved and reloaded upon the next launch.

7. Input Validation: Ensures only valid blood types and positive integers are entered to prevent data corruption.

## Technologies & Tools Used
1. Language: Python 3.x
2. Libraries:
             csv (Built-in): For reading and writing inventory data to the file system.
             os (Built-in): For file existence checks.
3. Interface: Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Steps to Install & Run
1. Prerequisites
   You must have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
2. Installation
   A.Download the file blooddndprgm.py.
   B.Place the file in a folder where you have write permissions (the script needs to create a CSV file in the same directory).
3. Running the Application
   A.Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal).
   B.Navigate to the directory containing the script.
   C.Run the following command:
       Bash
       python blooddndprgm.py
   D.On the first run, the system will automatically create a file named blood_inventory.csv with default stock values.

## Instructions for Testing
To ensure the system is working correctly, follow these testing steps:

Test 1: Verify Initial Load

 A.Run the program.
 B.Select Option 1 (Display Current Inventory).
 C.Verify that you see a list of blood types with default values (e.g., O- should have 15 units).

Test 2: Receive a Donation

 A.Select Option 2 (Receive New Units).
 B.Enter Blood Type: O- (Universal Donor).
 C.Enter Units: 5.
 D.The system should confirm the addition. Check Option 1 again to ensure O- is now 20 units (15 + 5).

Test 3: Test Compatibility & Dispensing

 A.Select Option 3 (Dispense Units).
 B.Enter Recipient Blood Type: B+.
 C.The system should list compatible donors: B+, B-, O+, O-.
 D.Select a donor type from the list (e.g., O+).
 E.Enter an amount to dispense (e.g., 2).
 F.The system should confirm the dispense action.

Test 4: Verify Persistence

 A.Select Option 4 to exit the program.
 B.Run the program again (python blooddndprgm.py).
 C.Select Option 1.
 D.Verify that the changes made in Test 2 and Test 3 are still present (The inventory should not have reset to default).
